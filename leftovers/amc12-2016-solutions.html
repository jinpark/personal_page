<h1>AMC 10 2016 Solutions</h1>

<h3>Solution 1</h3>
<p>The difference between the high and low temperatures was $16$ degrees, so the difference between each of these and the average temperature was $8$ degrees. The low temperature was $8$ degrees less than the average, so it was $3^\circ - 8^\circ = -5^\circ$.</p>
<h3>Solution 2</h3>
<p>To correct the error the student must subtract $35$ $095$ and add $35$.$95$. That is, she must subtract $35 095 - 35.95 = 35$ $059$.$05$</p>
<h3>Solution 3</h3>
<p>The value of an exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the values of the two interior opposite angles.</p>
<p>Hence $x = 80 + 40 = 120$.</p>
<h3>Solution 4</h3>
<p>$3m + 4n = {\text{odd}} + {\text{even}} = {\text{odd,}}$ all the others are even</p>
<h3>Solution 5</h3>
<p>We note</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray} {\text{ }}7s = 4m,\,{\text{i}}{\text{.e}}{\text{.}}\,s =  \frac{{4m}}{7},\,(1) \\  {\text{and}}\,5t = 6m,\,{\text{i}}{\text{.e}}{\text{.}}\,t = \frac{{6m}}{5}.\,(2) \\ {\text{Comparing}}\,(1)\,{\text{and}}\,(2),\,s &lt; m &lt; t \end{eqnarray}</p>
<h3>Solution 6</h3>
<p>$Alternative\ 1$</p>
<p>Adding the two numbers and isolating those parts which are multiples of $9$ we have<br>$$\eqalign{  &amp; 6a3 + 2b5 = 600 + 10a + 3 + 200 + 10b + 5  \cr   &amp;  = 808 + 10a + 10b  \cr   &amp;  = 801 + 9a + 9b + a + b + 7  \cr   &amp;  = 9\left( {89 + a + b} \right) + \left( {a + b + 7} \right) \cr} $$<br>Now since $0 \leq a \leq 9$ and $0 \leq b \leq 9,\,0 \leq a + b \leq 18$. If $a + b + 7$ is to be divisible by $9$ then $a + b = 2$ or $11$. Thus the largest possible value is $11$</p>
<p>$Alternative\ 2$</p>
<p>Let $N = 6a3 + 2b5.$ Either $a + b &lt; 10\,or\,a + b \geq 10.$ Then $N = 8\left( {a + b} \right)8,$ i.e. $N = 9\left( {a + b - 10} \right)8$. But $N\left| 9 \right..$ Thus $a + b = 2\,{\text{or}}\,a + b - 10 = 1\,{\text{and}}\,a + b = 11$ is the largest possible value of $a$ + $b$</p>
<h3>Solution 7</h3>
<p>Let the weight of the new potato be $x$ units and the weight of the $4$ potatoes at the start be $y$ units.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}  2 \times \dfrac{y}{4} &amp;=&amp; \dfrac{{x + y}}{5} \\<br>10y &amp;=&amp; 4x + 4y\\ 6y &amp;=&amp; 4x \\<br>\dfrac{x}{y} &amp;=&amp; \dfrac{3}{2} \end{eqnarray}</p>
<h3>Solution 8</h3>
<p>Since $p &gt; 0$ the direction of the inequalities for $x$ will not change on multiplication by $p$. Thus $ - 2.4p &lt; px &lt; - 1.5p$  implies $ - 4.8 &lt; px &lt; 0$</p>
<h3>Solution 9</h3>
<p>Two triangles are equiangular and hence similar.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br>  \frac{x}<br>{{20}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{{20}}<br>{{24}} \\<br>  x &amp;=&amp; \frac{{20 \times 60}}<br>{{24}} \\<br>   &amp;=&amp; 50 \end{eqnarray}</p>

<h3>Solution 10</h3>
<p>At $30$ km/h the convoy travels $1$ km in $2$ minutes. At $20$ km/h the convoy travels $1$ km in $3$ minutes. Thus at $20$ km/h the convoy is $1$ minute slower per kilometre. To lose $2$ hours, or $120$ minutes, takes $120$ km, hence this must be the distance from $P $to $Q$. At $30$ km/h the convoy takes $4$ hours. It must take $5$ hours. Thus the speed required is $\left( {\frac{{120}}{5}} \right)$ km/h, or $24$ km/h</p>
<h3>Solution 11</h3>
<p>Now $p + q + r + s + t = 5r = {m^3}$. Therefore $5|{m^3}$ and hence $5|m$.</p>
<p>Therefore ${5^3}|{m^3}$ and hence ${5^2}|r$.</p>
<p>Also $q + r + s = 3r = {n^2}$. Therefore $3|{n^2}$ and hence $3|n$.</p>
<p>Therefore ${3^2}|{n^2}$ and hence $3|r$.</p>
<p>Now $3|r$ and $3|{m^3}$. Therefore $3|m$ and ${3^3}|{m^3}$. Thus ${3^3}|r$, and the smallest $r $is $r = {3^3} \times {5^2} = 675$</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Solution 12</h3>
<p>Let the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus be $2$$a$ and $2$$b$, as shown $(a &gt; b)$. By Pythagoras, the side length is $\sqrt {{a^2} + {b^2}} $. Since the area of the square is double the area of the rhombus, $A{C^2} = 2 \times (2 \times \Delta ABC)$. Thus ${a^2} + {b^2} = 2(2ab)$, i.e. $\frac{{{a^2}}}{{{b^2}}} + 1 = 4\left( {\frac{a}{b}} \right)$, on division by ${b^2}$. So ${\left( {\frac{a}{b}} \right)^2} - 4\left( {\frac{a}{b}} \right) + 1 = 0$, and</p>
<p>$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{{4 \pm \sqrt {16 - 4} }}{2} = \frac{{4 \pm 2\sqrt 3 }}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt 3 $$.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p6519/page203_-_p22.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="263"></p>
<p>Since $a &gt; b$, it follows that $\frac{a}{b} &gt; 1$ and the required ratio, $\frac{a}{b} = 2 + \sqrt 3 $</p>
<h3>Solution 13</h3>
<p>$P$ moves along $3$ circular arcs. The first rotation about $R$ is $180^\circ $ with a radius of the diagonal of the square, $\sqrt 2 $. This arc is then of length $\pi \times \sqrt 2 $.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p7698/page278_S1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="299"></p>
<p>The next rotation about $Q$ is $180^\circ $ with radius $1$, so the length is $\pi $.</p>
<p>The third rotation is about $P$ so $P$ does not move.</p>
<p>The last rotation is $180^\circ $ about $L$ with radius $1$ so has length $\pi $.</p>
<p>The total length of the path traced out is then</p>
<p>$$\pi \times \sqrt 2 + \pi+ \pi = \pi (2 + \sqrt 2 )$$</p>
<h3>Solution 14</h3>
<p>$$\eqalign{<br>  &amp;  - a = {\log _2}\left( {{{\left( {{{\log }_{16}}2} \right)}^{\left( {{\text{1o}}{{\text{g}}_{\text{5}}}125} \right)}}} \right)  \cr<br>  &amp;  = {\log _2}\left( {{{\left( {\frac{1}{4}} \right)}^3}} \right)  \cr<br>  &amp;  = {\log _2}\left( {{2^{ - 6}}} \right)  \cr<br>  &amp;  =  - 6 \cr} $$</p>
<h3>Solution 15</h3>
<p>Let $C_1 $ be card $1$ (drawn first) and $C_2 $ be card $2$ (drawn second).</p>
<p>$$<br>\eqalign{  &amp; N_1  = {\text{total}}\,{\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{include}}\,{\text{exactly}}\,{\text{one}}\,{\text{ace}}  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{for}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{(}}C_{\text{1}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{four}}\,{\text{aces,}}\,C_{\text{2}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{12}}\,{\text{non - aces}}\,{\text{)}}\,{\text{or}}\,{\text{(}}C_{\text{1}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{12}}\,{\text{non - aces,}}\,C_{\text{2}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{four}}\,{\text{aces)}}  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = (4 \times 12) + (12 \times 4) = 96.  \cr   &amp; N_2  = {\text{total}}\,{\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{for}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{both}}\,{\text{cards}}\,{\text{are}}\,{\text{aces}}  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{for}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{(}}C_{\text{1}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{four}}\,{\text{aces,}}\,C_{\text{2}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{three}}\,{\text{remaining}}\,{\text{aces}})  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 4 \times 3 = 12. \cr} $$</p>
<p>Therefore the probability of $2$ aces given that at least one is an ace</p>
<p>$$ = \frac{{N_2 }}{{N_1  + N_2 }} = \frac{1}{9}$$</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Solution 16</h3>
<p>$Alternative 1$</p>
<p>If $x$ is a solution then</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br> a + x &amp;=&amp; a^2 - 2a\sqrt {a - x} + a - x \\<br> 2a\sqrt {a - x} &amp;=&amp; a^2 - 2x \\<br>  4a^2 (a - x) &amp;= &amp;a^4 - 4a^2 x + 4x^2 \\<br> 4x^2 &amp;=&amp; a^3 (4 - a). \end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>Consequently $0 \leq a \leq 4.$</p>
<p>The possible positive integer solution are 1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>Check:</p>
<p>$a = 1,\sqrt {1 + x} + \sqrt {1 - x} &gt; 1,$ not a solution;</p>
<p>$a = 2,x = 2,$ a solution;</p>
<p>$a = 4,x = 0,$ a solution.</p>
<p>What about $a = 3?$</p>
<p>$$\sqrt {3 + 0} + \sqrt {3 - 0} = 2\sqrt 3 &gt; 3 &gt; \sqrt {3 + 3} + \sqrt {3 - 3} = \sqrt 6 $$</p>
<p>so, by continuity, there is a solution for $x$ between $0$ and $3$.</p>
<p>There are then $3$ values of $a: 2,\ 3$ and $4$</p>
<p>$Alternative 2$</p>
<p>Sketch the graphs of $\sqrt {a + x} $ and $\sqrt {a - x} $ together.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p7443/page189_s1.jpg" alt="" width="811" height="309"></p>
<p>Adding these two, we have a function only defined between $ - a$ and $a$.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p7444/page190_s2.jpg" alt="" width="766" height="450"></p>
<p>It is clear that the equation $\sqrt {a + x} + \sqrt {a - x} = a$ can only have a solution when $\sqrt {2a} \leq a \leq 2\sqrt a .$</p>
<p>Since $a &gt; 0$ is given, we may square throughout with impunity to get $2a \leq a^2 \leq 4a$ and so $2 \leq a \leq 4$, giving three possibilities, $2,\ 3$ and $4$</p>
<h3>Solution 17</h3>
<p>However many sheep are bought, their cost, in dollars, will end in $0$. The cost of hens will be even. As the total cost ends in $9$, the number of cows must be odd, with cost ending in $5$ and the number of hens must be such that their cost ends in $4$. Thus there are $2$$n$ + $1$ cows and $5$$m$ + $2$ hens ($m$ and $n$ integers). By subtraction there are ($97$ â€“ $2$$n$ - $5$$m$) sheep. Costing these gives:</p>
<p>$$\eqalign{  &amp; 3279 = 65(2n + 1) + 2(5m + 2) + 40(97 - 2n - 5m)  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 3949 + 50n + 190m. \cr} $$</p>
<p>Therefore $190$$m$ - $50$$n$ = $670$ and so $n$ = $\frac{{19m - 67}}{5}$. Now, if the numerator is to be divisible by $5$, $19$$m$ must end in $7$ or $2$, so $m$ must end in $3$ or $8$.<br>If $m = 3,n &lt; 0:$ not possible.<br>If $m = 8,n = 17:$ $42$ hens, $35$ cows, $23$ sheep.<br>If $m = 13,n = 36:$ $65$ hens, $73$ cows: i.e. too many animals.<br>Thus the farmer bought $42$ hens, $35$ cows, $23$ sheep,<br>$Note$: There are many alternative ways of answering this question.</p>
<h3>Solution 18</h3>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p7071/Page251_S5.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="199"></p>
<p>The solid will be cylinder, radius of base $\sqrt 3 $ and height $2$, and two cones, height $1$ and radius of base $\sqrt {3.} $</p>
<p>The volume then is</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}  V&amp;=&amp;\pi (\sqrt 3 )^2 \times 2 + 2\frac{1}{3} \times \pi (\sqrt 3 )^2 \\ &amp; {\text{ }} &amp;=6\pi + 2\pi \\ &amp; {\text{ }} &amp;=8\pi  \end{eqnarray}</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Solution 19</h3>
<p>Call a permutation <em>balanced</em> if $a_1+ a_2 = a_4 + a_5$, and consider the number of balanced permutations. The sum of all five entries is odd, so in a balanced permutation, $a_3$ must be $1$, $3$, or $5$. For each choice of $a_3$, there is a unique way to group the remaining four numbers into two sets whose elements have equal sums. For example, if $a_3 = 1$, the two sets must be $\{2, 5\}$ and $\{3, 4\}$. Any one of the four numbers can be $a_1$, and the value of $a_2$ is then determined. Either of the two remaining numbers can be $a_4$, and the value of $a_5$ is then determined. Thus there are $3\cdot 2\cdot 4 = 24$ balanced permutations of $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$, and $5! -24=96$ permutations that are not balanced. Call a permutation <em>heavy-headed</em> if $a_1 + a_2 &gt; a_4 + a_5$. Reversing the entries in a heavy-headed permutation yields a unique heavy-tailed permutation, and vice versa, so there are exactly as many heavy-headed permutations as heavy-tailed ones. Therefore the number of heavy-tailed permutations is $\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot96=48$.</p>
<h3>Solution 20</h3>
<p>$Alternative\ 1$</p>
<p>Label points $P$, $Q$, etc and mark distances and angles as shown in the diagram. $\vartriangle PQT$ becomes $\vartriangle PUT$ by reflection across $PT$. Then $TU = \ell \,{\text{sin}}\,\theta$. Also $\angle QTP = \angle UTP = 90^\circ  - \theta $, so $\angle UTR = 20\theta$ and $TR = \ell \,\,{\text{sin}}\,\,\theta \,\,{\text{cos}}\,\,2\theta$.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p6842/Page197_S5_1.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="233"></p>
<p>Thus</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br> 6 = QT + TR = \ell {\text{sin}}\theta + \ell {\text{sin}}\theta {\text{cos}}2\theta &amp; = &amp; \ell {\text{sin}}\theta \left( {1 + {\text{cos}}2\theta } \right) \\<br> &amp; = &amp; 2\ell {\text{sin}}\theta {\text{co}}{{\text{s}}^2}\theta .<br> \end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>Thus $\ell = 3/(\sin \theta \cos^2\theta)$.</p>
<p>$Alternative\ 2$</p>
<p>Using the notation marked on the diagram, it can be seen that</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p6843/Page197_S5_2.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="195"></p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br>{\frac{6}{\ell }} &amp; = &amp; {\frac{6}{a} \times \frac{a}{\ell }} \\<br>{} &amp; = &amp; \sin2\theta \cos\theta \\<br>{} &amp; = &amp; 2\sin\theta \cos^2\theta .<br>\end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>Thus ${{\ell = 6} / {\left( {2\,\,\sin \,\,\theta \,\,{{\cos }^2}\,\,\theta } \right)}}$</p>
<h3>Solution 21</h3>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br> &amp; S = 1 + 11 + 111 +  \cdots  + \underbrace {111 \cdots 111}_{2002digits} \\<br> &amp; 10S = 10 + 110 + 1110 +  \cdots  + \underbrace {111 \cdots 110}_{{\text{2002}}digits} + \underbrace {111 \cdots 110}_{2003digits} \\<br> &amp; 9S =  - 1 - 1 - 1 -  \cdots  - 1 + \underbrace {111 \cdots 110}_{{\text{2003}}digits} \\<br> &amp;  =  - 2002 + \underbrace {111 \cdots 110}_{2003digits} \\<br> &amp;  = \underbrace {111 \cdots 1100000}_{2003digits} + 11110 - 2002 \\<br> &amp;  = \underbrace {111 \cdots 1100000}_{2003digits} + 09108 \\<br> &amp;  = \underbrace {111 \cdots 1109108}_{2003digits} \\<br> &amp; {\text{thaus }}S = \underbrace {111 \cdots 1109108}_{2003digits}/9 \end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>Now, dividing $111111111$ by $9$ gives exactly $012345679$. Since $2003 = 222 \times 9 + 5$, we also need to calculate $09108/9 = 01012$. Hence if we break $95$ into $222$ blocks of length $9$, together with $09108$, we obtain</p>
<p>$$S = \underbrace {012345679 \cdots 01234567901012}_{222times}$$</p>
<p>The number of $1$s in the result is then $222 + 2 = 224$</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Solution 22</h3>
<p>The center of the disk lies in a region $R$, consisting of all points within 1 unit of both $A$ and $B$. Let $C$ and $D$ be the points of intersection of the circles of radius 1 centered at $A$ and $B$. Because $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ABD$ are equilateral, arcs $CAD$ and $CBD$ are each $120^{\circ}$. Thus the sector bounded by $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{BD}$, and arc $CAD$ has area $\pi/3$, as does the sector bounded by $\overline{AC}$, $\overline{AD}$, and arc $CBD$. The intersection of the two sectors, which is the union of the two triangles, has area $\sqrt{3}/2$, so the area of $R$ is \[ \frac{2\pi}{3}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]</p>

<p>The region $S$ consists of all points within 1 unit of $R$. In addition to $R$ itself, $S$ contains two $60^\circ$ sectors of radius 1 and two $120^\circ$ annuli of outer radius 2 and inner radius 1. The area of each sector is $\pi/6$, and the area of each annulus is \[ \frac{\pi}{3}(2^{2}-1^{2})=\pi. \] Therefore the area of $S$ is \[ \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 2\left(\frac{\pi}{6}+\pi \right)= 3\pi-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]</p>

<h3>Solution 23</h3>
<p>By the Binomial Theorem, $$(1+i)^{99} =\binom{99}{0} + \binom{99}{1}i+\binom{99}{2}i^2+\binom{99}{3}i^3 +\ldots+\binom{99}{99}i^{99}$$ Note that the real part of this series is $$\binom{99}{0}-\binom{99}{2}+\binom{99}{4}-\binom{99}{6}+\ldots-\binom{99}{98}$$ the very sum we want to find. Since $\displaystyle (1+i)=\sqrt{2}\left(\cos\frac{\pi}{4}+i\sin\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$, by DeMoivre's Theorem $\displaystyle (1+i)^{99}=2^{\frac{99}{2}}\left(\cos\frac{99\pi}{4}+i\sin\frac{99\pi}{4}\right)$. Thus the real part of $(1+i)^{99}$ is $\displaystyle 2^{\frac{99}{2}}\cos\frac{99\pi}{4} = 2^{\frac{99}{2}}\cos\frac{3\pi}{4} =2^{\frac{99}{4}}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = -2^{49}$.</p>
<h3>Solution 24</h3>
<p>Because each ant can move from its vertex to any of four adjacent vertices, there are $4^6$ possible combinations of moves. In the following, consider only those combinations in which no two ants arrive at the same vertex. Label the vertices as $A$, $B$, $C$, $A'$, $B'$ and $C'$, where $A'$, $B'$ and $C'$ are opposite $A$, $B$ and $C$, respectively. Let $f$ be the function that maps each ant's starting vertex onto its final vertex. Then neither of $f(A)$ nor $f(A')$ can be either $A$ or $A'$, and similar statements hold for the other pairs of opposite vertices. Thus there are $4\cdot 3 = 12$ ordered pairs of values for $f(A)$ and $f(A')$. The vertices $f(A)$ and $f(A')$ are opposite each other in four cases and adjacent to each other in eight.</p>
<p>Suppose that $f(A)$ and $f(A')$ are opposite vertices, and, without loss of generality, that $f(A) = B$ and $f(A') = B'$. Then $f(C)$ must be either $A$ or $A'$ and $f(C')$ must be the other. Similarly, $f(B)$ must be either $C$ or $C'$ and $f(B')$ must be the other. Therefore there are $4\cdot 2\cdot 2 = 16$ combinations of moves in which $f(A)$ and $f(A')$ are opposite each other.</p>
<p>Suppose now that $f(A)$ and $f(A')$ are adjacent vertices, and, without loss of generality, that $f(A) = B$ and $f(A') = C$. Then one of $f(B)$ and $f(B')$ must be $C'$ and the other cannot be $B'$. So there are four possible ordered pairs of values for $f(B)$ and $f(B')$. For each of those there are two possible ordered pairs of values for $f(C)$ and $f(C')$. Therefore there are $8\cdot 4\cdot 2 = 64$ combinations of moves in which $f(A)$ and $f(A')$ are adjacent to each other.</p>
<p>Hence the probability that no two ants arrive at the same vertex is \[ \frac{16 + 64}{4^6} = \frac{5\cdot 2^4}{2^{12}} = \frac{5}{256}. \]</p>
<h3>Solution 25</h3>
<p>If $a$ is the leading coefficient of $P(x)$, then the leading coefficients of $P(x^2)$ and $P(x)P(-x)$ are $a^2$ and $a$, respectively, so $a = 1$.</p>
<p>Note that if $r$ is a root of $P$ then $r^2$ is also a root. Therefore $r, r^2, r^{2^2}, r^{2^3},\cdots,$ are all roots of $P$. Since $P$ has a finite number of roots, two of these roots should be equal. Therefore, either $r = 0$ or $r^N = 1$ for some $N &gt; 0$.</p>
<p>If all roots are equal to $0$ or $1$, then $P = x^b(x - 1)^{(4-b)}$ for $b = 0,\ldots, 4$. Therefore there are $5$ such polynomials.</p>
<p>Now suppose this is not the case. For such a polynomial, let $q$ denote the largest integer such that $r = e^{2\pi i\cdot p/q}$ is a root for some integer $p$ coprime to $q$. We claim that the only suitable $q &gt; 1$ are $q = 3$ and $q = 5$.</p>
<p>First note that if $r$ is a root then one of $\sqrt{r}$ or $-\sqrt{r}$ is also a root. So if $q$ is even, then one of $e^{2\pi i\cdot p/2q}$ or $e^{2\pi i(p+q)/2q}$ should also be root of $p$, and both $p/2q$ and $(p + q)/2q$ are irreducible fractions. This contradicts the assumption that $q$ is maximal. Therefore $q$ must be odd. Now, if $q &gt; 6$, then $r^{-2}, r^{-1}, r, r^2, r^4$ should be all distinct, so $q \leq 6$. Therefore $q = 5$ or $3$.</p>
<p>If $q = 5$, then the value of $p$ is not important as $P$ has the complex fifth roots of unity as its roots, so $P = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$, and this case gives just $1$ possible polynomial.</p>
<p>If $q = 3$, then $P$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$. In this case we let $P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)Q(x)$ and repeating the same reasoning we can show that $Q(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ or $Q(x)$ is of form $x^b(x-1)^{2-b}$. Thus this case gives $4$ possible polynomials.</p>
<p>Finally, we can show that exactly one member of all $10$ resulting families of polynomials fits the desired criteria. Let $P(x) = (x- r)$ $(x-s)$ $(x-t)$ $(x-u)$. Then, $P(x)P(-x) = (x^2-r^2)$ $(x^2-s^2)$ $(x^2 -t^2)$ $(x^2-u^2)$. We now claim that $r^2, s^2, t^2$, and $u^2$ equal $r$, $s$, $t$, and $u$ in some order. We can prove this noting that the mapping $f(x) = x^2$ maps $0$ and $1$ to themselves and maps the third and fifth roots of unity to another distinct third or fifth root of unity, respectively. Hence, for these polynomials, $P(x)P(-x) $ $= (x^2-r)(x^2-s)(x^2-t)(x^2-u) = aP(x^2)$, so there exist exactly $10$ polynomials that fit the desired criteria.</p>
