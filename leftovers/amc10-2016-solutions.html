<h1>AMC 10 2016 Solutions</h1>

<h3>Solution 1</h3>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br>250 - 249 + 248 - 247 + \ldots + 2 - 1 \\<br>&amp; = &amp; (250 - 249) + (248 - 247) + \ldots + (2 - 1) \\<br>&amp; = &amp; 1 + 1 + 1 + \ldots + 1\,(125\,{\text{terms}}) \\<br>&amp; = &amp; 125<br>\end{eqnarray}</p>
<h3>Solution 2</h3>
<p>The difference between the high and low temperatures was $16$ degrees, so the difference between each of these and the average temperature was $8$ degrees. The low temperature was $8$ degrees less than the average, so it was $3^\circ - 8^\circ = -5^\circ$.</p>
<h3>Solution 3</h3>
<p>To correct the error the student must subtract $35$ $095$ and add $35$.$95$. That is, she must subtract $35 095 - 35.95 = 35$ $059$.$05$</p>
<h3>Solution 4</h3>
<p>The value of an exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the values of the two interior opposite angles.</p>
<p>Hence $x = 80 + 40 = 120$.</p>
<h3>Solution 5</h3>
<p>$3m + 4n = {\text{odd}} + {\text{even}} = {\text{odd,}}$ all the others are even</p>
<h3>Solution 6</h3>
<p>We note</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray} {\text{ }}7s = 4m,\,{\text{i}}{\text{.e}}{\text{.}}\,s =  \frac{{4m}}{7},\,(1) \\  {\text{and}}\,5t = 6m,\,{\text{i}}{\text{.e}}{\text{.}}\,t = \frac{{6m}}{5}.\,(2) \\ {\text{Comparing}}\,(1)\,{\text{and}}\,(2),\,s &lt; m &lt; t \end{eqnarray}</p>
<h3>Solution 7</h3>
<p>$Alternative\ 1$</p>
<p>Adding the two numbers and isolating those parts which are multiples of $9$ we have<br>$$\eqalign{  &amp; 6a3 + 2b5 = 600 + 10a + 3 + 200 + 10b + 5  \cr   &amp;  = 808 + 10a + 10b  \cr   &amp;  = 801 + 9a + 9b + a + b + 7  \cr   &amp;  = 9\left( {89 + a + b} \right) + \left( {a + b + 7} \right) \cr} $$<br>Now since $0 \leq a \leq 9$ and $0 \leq b \leq 9,\,0 \leq a + b \leq 18$. If $a + b + 7$ is to be divisible by $9$ then $a + b = 2$ or $11$. Thus the largest possible value is $11$</p>
<p>$Alternative\ 2$</p>
<p>Let $N = 6a3 + 2b5.$ Either $a + b &lt; 10\,or\,a + b \geq 10.$ Then $N = 8\left( {a + b} \right)8,$ i.e. $N = 9\left( {a + b - 10} \right)8$. But $N\left| 9 \right..$ Thus $a + b = 2\,{\text{or}}\,a + b - 10 = 1\,{\text{and}}\,a + b = 11$ is the largest possible value of $a$ + $b$</p>
<h3>Solution 8</h3>
<p>The total average wear on the four tyres in $1$ km is</p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{4}\left( {\frac{1}{{40\,\,000}} + \frac{1}{{40\,\,000}} + \frac{1}{{60\,\,000}} + \frac{1}{{60\,\,000}}} \right) = \frac{1}{{48\,\,000}}$$</p>
<p>of their capacity. Thus, presuming use of the tyres on each wheel is optimised, the maximum distance which the car can travel is $48$ $000$ km</p>
<h3>Solution 9</h3>
<p>Draw additional lines to cover the entire figure with congruent triangles. There are 24 triangles in the blue region, 24 in the white region, and 16 in the black region. Thus, $B=W$. All of the other equalities are false.</p>

<h3>Solution 10</h3>
<p>Let the weight of the new potato be $x$ units and the weight of the $4$ potatoes at the start be $y$ units.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}  2 \times \dfrac{y}{4} &amp;=&amp; \dfrac{{x + y}}{5} \\<br>10y &amp;=&amp; 4x + 4y\\ 6y &amp;=&amp; 4x \\<br>\dfrac{x}{y} &amp;=&amp; \dfrac{3}{2} \end{eqnarray}</p>
<h3>Solution 11</h3>
<p>Since $p &gt; 0$ the direction of the inequalities for $x$ will not change on multiplication by $p$. Thus $ - 2.4p &lt; px &lt; - 1.5p$  implies $ - 4.8 &lt; px &lt; 0$</p>
<h3>Solution 12</h3>
<p>Suppose the original length is $\ell $ units and the original breadth is $b $units. Then the new length is $\frac{1}{{10}}\left( {12\ell } \right)$ units and the new breadth is $\frac{1}{{10}}\left( {12b} \right)$ units. Thus the new area is $\frac{1}{{100}}\left( {144\ell b} \right)$ square units. The percentage increase is thus $44\%$</p>
<h3>Solution 13</h3>
<p>parabola with the given equation and with vertex $(p,p)$ must have equation $y=a(x-p)^2+p$. Because the $y$-intercept is $(0,-p)$ and $p\ne 0$, it follows that $a=-2/p$. Thus \[ y=-\frac{2}{p}(x^2-2px+p^2)+p=-\frac{2}{p}x^2+4x-p, \] so $b=4$.</p>
<h3>Solution 14</h3>
<p>Now $p + q + r + s + t = 5r = {m^3}$. Therefore $5|{m^3}$ and hence $5|m$.</p>
<p>Therefore ${5^3}|{m^3}$ and hence ${5^2}|r$.</p>
<p>Also $q + r + s = 3r = {n^2}$. Therefore $3|{n^2}$ and hence $3|n$.</p>
<p>Therefore ${3^2}|{n^2}$ and hence $3|r$.</p>
<p>Now $3|r$ and $3|{m^3}$. Therefore $3|m$ and ${3^3}|{m^3}$. Thus ${3^3}|r$, and the smallest $r $is $r = {3^3} \times {5^2} = 675$</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Solution 15</h3>
<p>$P$ moves along $3$ circular arcs. The first rotation about $R$ is $180^\circ $ with a radius of the diagonal of the square, $\sqrt 2 $. This arc is then of length $\pi \times \sqrt 2 $.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p7698/page278_S1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="299"></p>
<p>The next rotation about $Q$ is $180^\circ $ with radius $1$, so the length is $\pi $.</p>
<p>The third rotation is about $P$ so $P$ does not move.</p>
<p>The last rotation is $180^\circ $ about $L$ with radius $1$ so has length $\pi $.</p>
<p>The total length of the path traced out is then</p>
<p>$$\pi \times \sqrt 2 + \pi+ \pi = \pi (2 + \sqrt 2 )$$</p>
<h3>Solution 16</h3>
<p>Suppose $x$ cm is removed at each corner, as shown. Then clearly $BC$ has length $(n - x){\text{cm}}$. Consider the right-angled isosceles triangle, $XYZ$ as shown. $\Delta $s$XYZ$, $ACB$ are similar. Therefore</p>

<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p6523/page203_-_p23_2.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="201"></p>
<p>$$\eqalign{<br>  &amp; \frac{x}{{n - 2x}} = \frac{1}{{\sqrt 2 }}{\text{  }} \Rightarrow {\text{ }}x = \frac{n}{{2 + \sqrt 2 }}  \cr<br>  &amp; {\text{                                }} = \frac{{n(2 - \sqrt 2 )}}{2}  \cr<br>  &amp; {\text{                        }} \Rightarrow {\text{ }}x = \frac{{{n^2}(6 - 4\sqrt 2 )}}{4}  \cr<br>  &amp; {\text{                                   = }}\frac{{{n^2}(3 - 2\sqrt 2 )}}{2}. \cr} $$</p>
<p>The total area removed is $2{x^2}{\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^2} = {n^2}(3 - 2\sqrt 2 ){\text{c}}{{\text{m}}^2}$</p>
<h3>Solution 17</h3>
<p><em>First solution. </em>Let $u$ be the speed of the men and $x$ the distance travelled by the inspecting officer. The officer's speed is $ux$. While he is moving forwaard, the speed of the officer relative to the column is $u(x-1)$, so the time it takes him to reach the front of the column is $\frac{1}{u(x-1)}$. On return to the rear, his relative speed is $u(x+1)$, so the time required is $\frac{1}{u(x+1)}$. Since the time required for the column to travel the kilometer is $\frac{1}{u}$, we obtain (after multiplying by $u$), $$\frac{1}{x-1}+\frac{1}{x+1}=1.$$ Thus $x^2-2x-1=0$. The negative root is not applicable, so $x=1+\sqrt{2}$. Hence the officer travels $1+\sqrt{2}$ kilometers.</p>
<p><em>Second solution.</em> Let $v$ and $u$ denote the speeds of the officer and men respectively. Also, let $t$ and $s$ denote the time taken for the officer to get to the front and back again respectively. Then $(v-u)t=1$, $(v+u)s=1$ and $u(t+s)=1$. Hence $$u\left(\frac{1}{v-u}+\frac{1}{v+u}\right)=1,$$ or $$v^2-2vu-u^2=0,$$ so that $v=u(1+\sqrt{2})$. The distance travelled by the officer is therefore $$v(t+s)=u(1+\sqrt{2})\frac{1}{u}=1+\sqrt{2}$$ kilometers.</p>
<h3>Solution 18</h3>
<p>$Alternative\ 1$</p>
<p>In the diagram, points $O$, $P$, $Q $and $R $have been marked and it can be seen that $OPQ $is an equilateral triangle with side length $1$ unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p6756/Page168_S26.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="207"></p>
<p>The shaded area is the area of the upper semi-circle on diameter $OR $minus the area of the arched region bounded by $O$, $P $and $Q$. The latter area is twice the area of the circle sector $OPQ $minus the area of the equilateral triangle $OPQ $(which would otherwise have been counted twice). This equals</p>
<p>$$\eqalign{<br>  &amp; \frac{1}{2} \times \pi  \times {1^2}--\left( {2 \times \,\,\,\,\,\underbrace {\frac{1}{2} \times {1^2} \times \frac{1}{3}\pi }_{{\text{area}}\,\,{\text{sector}}\,\,OPQ}\,\,\,\,\,--\underbrace {\frac{1}{2} \times {1^2} \times \sin \frac{1}{3}\pi }_{{\text{area}}\,\,\vartriangle OPQ}} \right),  \cr<br>  &amp;  = \frac{1}{2}\pi --\frac{1}{3}\pi  + \frac{1}{4}\sqrt 3 ,  \cr<br>  &amp;  = \frac{1}{6}\pi  + \frac{1}{4}\sqrt 3 , \cr} $$</p>
<p>$Alternative\ 2$</p>
<p>Using the notation of the diagram of Alternative\ $1$,</p>
<p>Area ${\text{shaded}} = {\text{area}}$ of sector defined by $PQR$</p>
<p>                                      minus unshaded area of this sector</p>
<p>$$\eqalign{<br>  &amp;  = \frac{1}{2} \times {1^2} \times \frac{2}{3}\pi --\frac{1}{2}\left( {\frac{1}{3}\pi --\frac{1}{2}\sqrt 3 } \right)  \cr<br>  &amp;  = \frac{1}{3}\pi --\frac{1}{6}\pi  + \frac{1}{4}\sqrt 3  = \frac{1}{6}\pi  + \frac{1}{4}\sqrt 3 , \cr} $$</p>
<p>$Alternative\ 3$</p>
<p>Construct three equilateral triangles $OPQ$, $PQS $and $QRS $as shown, each with side length $1$ unit. Each of these triangles has area</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p6757/Page168_S26_2.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="239"></p>
<p>$\frac{1}{2} \times {1^2} \times {\text{sin}}\,\,60^\circ = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt 3 $ square units. Sector $QSR $has area $\frac{1}{2} \times {1^2} \times \frac{1}{3}\pi = \frac{1}{6}\pi $$ $square units. It can thus be seen that the total area shaded is $\frac{1}{6}\pi + \frac{1}{4}\sqrt 3 $ square units</p>
<h3>Solution 19</h3>
<p>Let $C_1 $ be card $1$ (drawn first) and $C_2 $ be card $2$ (drawn second).</p>
<p>$$<br>\eqalign{  &amp; N_1  = {\text{total}}\,{\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{include}}\,{\text{exactly}}\,{\text{one}}\,{\text{ace}}  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{for}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{(}}C_{\text{1}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{four}}\,{\text{aces,}}\,C_{\text{2}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{12}}\,{\text{non - aces}}\,{\text{)}}\,{\text{or}}\,{\text{(}}C_{\text{1}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{12}}\,{\text{non - aces,}}\,C_{\text{2}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{four}}\,{\text{aces)}}  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = (4 \times 12) + (12 \times 4) = 96.  \cr   &amp; N_2  = {\text{total}}\,{\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{for}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{both}}\,{\text{cards}}\,{\text{are}}\,{\text{aces}}  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\text{number}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{pairs}}\,{\text{for}}\,{\text{which}}\,{\text{(}}C_{\text{1}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{four}}\,{\text{aces,}}\,C_{\text{2}}  = {\text{one}}\,{\text{of}}\,{\text{three}}\,{\text{remaining}}\,{\text{aces}})  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 4 \times 3 = 12. \cr} $$</p>
<p>Therefore the probability of $2$ aces given that at least one is an ace</p>
<p>$$ = \frac{{N_2 }}{{N_1  + N_2 }} = \frac{1}{9}$$</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Solution 20</h3>
<p>Since the difference of the first two terms is $-2y$, the third and fourth terms of the sequence must be $x-3y$ and $x-5y$. Thus \[ x-3y = xy \quad\text{and}\quad x-5y = \frac{x}{y}, \] so $xy - 5y^{2} = x.$ Combining these equations we obtain \[ (x - 3y) - 5y^{2}= x\quad\text{and, therefore, }\quad -3y - 5y^{2} = 0. \] Since $y$ cannot be 0, we have $y = -3/5$, and it follows that $x = -9/8$. The fifth term in the sequence is $x - 7y = 123/40$.</p>
<h3>Solution 21</h3>
<p>However many sheep are bought, their cost, in dollars, will end in $0$. The cost of hens will be even. As the total cost ends in $9$, the number of cows must be odd, with cost ending in $5$ and the number of hens must be such that their cost ends in $4$. Thus there are $2$$n$ + $1$ cows and $5$$m$ + $2$ hens ($m$ and $n$ integers). By subtraction there are ($97$ – $2$$n$ - $5$$m$) sheep. Costing these gives:</p>
<p>$$\eqalign{  &amp; 3279 = 65(2n + 1) + 2(5m + 2) + 40(97 - 2n - 5m)  \cr   &amp; \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 3949 + 50n + 190m. \cr} $$</p>
<p>Therefore $190$$m$ - $50$$n$ = $670$ and so $n$ = $\frac{{19m - 67}}{5}$. Now, if the numerator is to be divisible by $5$, $19$$m$ must end in $7$ or $2$, so $m$ must end in $3$ or $8$.<br>If $m = 3,n &lt; 0:$ not possible.<br>If $m = 8,n = 17:$ $42$ hens, $35$ cows, $23$ sheep.<br>If $m = 13,n = 36:$ $65$ hens, $73$ cows: i.e. too many animals.<br>Thus the farmer bought $42$ hens, $35$ cows, $23$ sheep,<br>$Note$: There are many alternative ways of answering this question.</p>
<h3>Solution 22</h3>
<p>Let the side of the square be $a$ and let $x$ and $y $ denote the distances shown. Then by Pythagoras’ Theorem we find that</p>
<p><img src="https://edfinity-embeds.s3.amazonaws.com/embed/p7110/P2.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="279"></p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray}<br>  x^2 + y^2 &amp;= &amp;16 \\<br>  {\text{ }}x^2 + (a - y)^2 &amp;=&amp; 25 \\<br>  {\text{and (}}a - x{\text{)}}^{\text{2}} + y^2 &amp;=&amp; 1. \end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>Subtracting the first of these from the second and third equations, and then solving the resulting equations for $x$ and $y$, one finds that</p>
<p>$$x = \frac{{a^2 + 15}}<br>{{2a}}{\text{ and }}y = \frac{{a^3 - 9}}<br>{{2a}}.$$</p>
<p>Substituting these values into the first equation, upon rearrangement, it follows that</p>
<p>$a^4 - 26a^2 + 153 = 0.$</p>
<p>Solving this quadratic equation in $a^2 $, we find that $a^2 = 17$ or $9$. We discard the second of these solutions, since a square of side length $3$ cannot contain a point $5$ units away from one of its vertices. Hence $a^2 $ must be $17$</p>
<h3>Solution 23</h3>
<p>Call a permutation <em>balanced</em> if $a_1+ a_2 = a_4 + a_5$, and consider the number of balanced permutations. The sum of all five entries is odd, so in a balanced permutation, $a_3$ must be $1$, $3$, or $5$. For each choice of $a_3$, there is a unique way to group the remaining four numbers into two sets whose elements have equal sums. For example, if $a_3 = 1$, the two sets must be $\{2, 5\}$ and $\{3, 4\}$. Any one of the four numbers can be $a_1$, and the value of $a_2$ is then determined. Either of the two remaining numbers can be $a_4$, and the value of $a_5$ is then determined. Thus there are $3\cdot 2\cdot 4 = 24$ balanced permutations of $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$, and $5! -24=96$ permutations that are not balanced. Call a permutation <em>heavy-headed</em> if $a_1 + a_2 &gt; a_4 + a_5$. Reversing the entries in a heavy-headed permutation yields a unique heavy-tailed permutation, and vice versa, so there are exactly as many heavy-headed permutations as heavy-tailed ones. Therefore the number of heavy-tailed permutations is $\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot96=48$.</p>
<h3>Solution 24</h3>
<p>We are looking for a maximum product</p>
<p>$$n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 \times \cdots \times n_k $$</p>
<p>where $n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 \times \cdots \times n_k = 19.$</p>
<p>If any factor $n_i {\text{ is }} \geq 5$, it can be replaced with $2 \times \left( {n_i - 2} \right)$ for a larger product, since $2\left( {x - 2} \right) &gt; x$ for $x \geq 5;$ so every factor is $ \leq 4.$</p>
<p>If any factor $n_i $ is equal to $4$, it can be replaced by $2 \times 2$ with no change to the product, so we shall do this and then every factor is$ \leq 3.$</p>
<p>If any factor is $1$, it can be combined with another factor, replacing $1 \times n_i $ by $\left( {n_i + 1} \right)$ which increases the product, so now all factors are $2$ or $3$.</p>
<p>If there are three or more $2$s, $2 \times 2 \times 2$ can be replaced by $3 \times 3$ to increase the product. So there are at most two $2$s.</p>
<p>There is only one way that $19$ can be written as such a sum: there are five $3$s and two $2$s.</p>
<p>So the maximum product is $3^5 \times 2^2 = 972.$</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">$\boxed{972}$</p>
<h3>Solution 25</h3>
<p>Suppose that John and Carol are two of the people. For $i = 1,2,\ldots, 19$, let $J_i$ and $C_i$ be the numbers of orderings (out of all $20!$) in which the $i$-th and $(i+1)$-st persons are John and Carol, or Carol and John, respectively. Then $J_i = C_i = 18!$ is the number of orderings of the remaining persons. For $i=1,2,\ldots,19$, let $N_i$ be the number of times a boy-girl or girl-boy pair occupies positions $i$ and $i+ 1$. Since there are $7$ boys and $13$ girls, $N_i = 7 \times 13 \times (J_i+C_i)$. Thus the average value of $S$ is $$\frac{N_1+N_2+\ldots+N_{19}}{20!} =\frac{19[7 \times 13 \times (18!+18!)]}{20!} =\frac{91}{10}$$</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>In general, suppose there are $k$ boys and $n-k$ girls. For $i=1,2,\ldots,n-1$ let $A_i$ be the probability that there is a boy-girl pair in positions $(i, i+ 1)$ in the line. Since there is either $0$ or $1$ pair in $(i,i + 1)$, $A_i$, is also the expected number of pairs in these positions. By symmetry, all $A_i$'s are the same (or note that the argument below is independent of $i$). Thus the answer is $(n-1)A_i$.</p>
<p>We may consider the boys indistinguishable and likewise the girls. (Why?) Then an order is just a sequence of $k$ $B$s and $n-k$ $G$s. To have a pair at $(i, i+ 1)$ we must have $BG$ or $GB$ in those positions, and the remaining $n-2$ positions must have $k-1$ boys and $n-k-1$ girls. Thus there are $\displaystyle 2\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ sequences with a pair at $(i, i + 1)$. Since there are $\binom{n}{k}$ sequences, the answer is $$(n-1)A_i =\frac{(n-1)2\binom{n-2}{k-1}}{\binom{n}{k}} =\frac{2k(n-k)}{n}$$ In our case, the answer is $\displaystyle \frac{2 \times 7 \times 13}{20} = \frac{91}{10}$.</p>
