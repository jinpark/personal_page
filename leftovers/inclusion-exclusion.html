<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Andrew wrote all the odd numbers from $1$ to $2011$ on a board and then Bob erased all the multiples of $3$. How many numbers were left on the board?</p>
<p>a. $335$</p>
<p>b. $336$</p>
<p>c. $671$</p>
<p>d. $1005$</p>
<p>e.$1006$</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>There are some balls in a raffle bucket. One positive integer is written on each ball; all the integers are different, and each is divisible by either $6$ or $7$. A number divisible by $6$ is written on exactly $30$ balls, a number divisible by $7$ is written on exactly $20$ balls and a number divisible by $42$ is written on exactly $10$ balls. How many balls are in the bucket?</p>
<p>a. $30$</p>
<p>b. $40$</p>
<p>c. $53$</p>
<p>d. $54$</p>
<p>e.$60$</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Everyone attending an international conference of mathematicians speaks either English, Russian, or Chinese. A total of $53$ people speak English, $39$ speak Russian, and $44$ speak Chinese. There are $31$ people who speak at least two of the three languanges, including $12$ who speak all three. How many mathematicians are attending the conference?</p>
<p>a. $81$</p>
<p>b. $93$</p>
<p>c. $100$</p>
<p>d. $117$</p>
<p>e.$136$</p>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>How many ways are there of choosing $3$ different numbers in increasing order from $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\}$ so that no two of the numbers are consecutive?</p>
<p>a. $20$</p>
<p>b. $48$</p>
<p>c. $56$</p>
<p>d. $54$</p>
<p>e.$72$</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>How many triangles with positive area are there whose vertices are points in the $xy$-plane whose coordinates are integers $(x,y)$ satisfying $1 \leq x \leq 4$ and $1 \leq y \leq 4$?</p>
<p>a. $496$</p>
<p>b. $500$</p>
<p>c. $512$</p>
<p>d. $516$</p>
