personal_page
=============

my personal page - jinpark.net

Just some standard html and css.

Uses backstretch.js for the image stretching and some simple jquery for the animations

Also uses my simple [image resizing/caching service](https://github.com/jinpark/imageresizer) to cache the background image.

Site is hosted by github pages are static files are cached through cloudflare.
